 FFmpeg desktop Streamer project
 
 Optional systray application
 script that creates customize Windows Service which keep ffmpeg alive
 easily parametrable, change all parameters from systray application from command line
 streamer input coordinate/monitornumber/application name following capture , changing TX/RX protocol , signal relevant changes to receiver
          change codec, all ffmpeg tuning options, bitrate, framerate, downscaling, cropping
 receiver same settings control from CLI, cropping of a larger stream, up/down scaling/ cropping		  
 Receiver scripts  that keep ffplay/mpv alive on the receiving end
 netcat or ssh to send control messages to services, ability to switch input of receiver and input of stream
 ability to send message to router, open port for port forwarding, enable multicast to unicast stream (with multiple destinations)
 ability to allow port forwarding from only one or several specific IPs and Hostnames (sender updates its IP via direct ssh or via ddns)
 
 systray application
 
 ability to create, delete, streamer and receiver services and see their current status  running, stopped, problem, waiting
 ability to reconfigure existing service quickly to change parameters
 the parameters, fixed streaming X/Y coordinate, possibly spanning multiple monitors, streaming whole monitor, streaming only an application windows
 with or window borders, service can change X/Y/Width/Heith to match resizing and moving of the application windows
 ability to stop streamer cleanly if a monitor disappears, ability to restart streamer automatically when monitor comes back
 ability to create new indirect monitors and change their relative location
 ability for receiver to switch to a new source if one source stops, ability to go back in waiting mode when stream stops (instead of staying stick on last frame)
 ffmpeg output logged to file
 log visible in systray application, with autoscroll if scrollbar it at bottom
 performance characteristics visible per streamer (frames per second, transmit jitter between frames, show CPU & GPU usage, show latency to associated listenenrs), hear parameters back from active listeners via ncat or ssh or stunnel
