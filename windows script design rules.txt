if a script is run by double clicking (no arguments) it should end with a conditionnal pause

scripts should attempt to load a "variables" script to have a single location 
for all changing settings, especiially download links and install filenames
builtin defaults
overridden by variables file
overridden by environement variables

there should be an output log file
temp folder and/or local folder can be overriden by variable file or env
log all console output but still show it also, timestamp logs ?

most files should work completely standalone

arguments should be able to be specified on command line and in the filename itself

concatenate scripts into super scripts that can be outputted as multiple pre-configured batch files




move instead of delete script
delete script should not need more permission than required 
restore permissions if possible ?

--------------

script to list, remove or create scheduled tasks
